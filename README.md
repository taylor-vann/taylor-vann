I make tools and applications using Rust, Golang, and Typescript. I'm a web development advocate and a big fan of [web apis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) (the browser stack).

Formerly:
- Google - Material and Lit
- Facebook - Data Center Tools.

The internet is a public utility and should be treated like one. Here's an [example](https://epb.com/campaigns/residential-internet) of a `public internet utility` in Chattanooga, TN providing a `1Gb` fiberoptic connection with no data caps for `1/3rd` of my Comcast bill in San Francisco, CA.

Vote like you're mad as hell.
